# Secret Gallery

Drop photos here to add them to Ruby's secret photo gallery!

## How it works
- Just add `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` files to this folder
- The site automatically loads all images from this directory
- Photos appear in the secret gallery (triple-click the footer to access)
- Images are lazy-loaded for performance

## Tips
- Use PicPerf URLs in production for optimal performance
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 2MB each)
- Images display in alphabetical order by filename
